1)   Identify the objects from the text above and create the class diagram for them. The classes should have attributes and methods that should be extracted from the text. [10 points]

   - no diagram 

Total 0p

2)   Create a main class in which you instantiate all the defined classes. [10 points]

     - the program works - 1p
     - all objects are instantiated and used -5p

Notes: 
- can not compare the program to the diagram
- no base class identified
- clean unused methods and members
- no move operation  
- use interface type private List<String> tags; instead of private ArrayList<String> tags;
